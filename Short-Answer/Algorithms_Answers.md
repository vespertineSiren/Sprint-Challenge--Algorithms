#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)
while loop has will not run through every n element, this is linear runtime complexity


b) 
The outer loop (for i in range(n):) will be running in O(n) since it goes through every element without jumps. 
The inner loop is a while loop which is equivalent to a for loop so that is O(n) but that second loop is kinda ignoring with the exception of resetting j
So... I will go with O(n)


c) O(n)
recursive call algorithm. eventually resolves itself down before before returning an open call. only really calls itself once each time though.
